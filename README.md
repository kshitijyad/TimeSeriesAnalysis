# TimeSeriesAnalysis

In this project I have demonstrated Sarimax and RNN function analysis on a Fortune 500 Ecommerce Gaint's Product data

This is a project for demonstration purpose only where I just give a brief overview of how to perform:

* Data Cleaning of Time Series Data
* Data Processing
* Show SMA graph
* Forcast using Sarimax
* Compare it with Recurrent Neural Network method

In reality this process is more complex and requires more analysis and tuning in order to get better result, but this is just a simple example of Time Series Analysis.
